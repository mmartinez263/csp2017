        <font face="impact" color="black"><p>My partner Dan and I created a remix of the Ping-Pong game. We were able to change a few things.  We added another paddle and we changed the colors of the paddle.  We also changed the movements and controls of the paddles so the player can move them more freely.</p>

    We added three new levels that range from easy to hard. Each level includes different sprites, backgrounds, and objectives.  It is a great and fun game that is enjoyable for everyone.</p>
