    <font face="impact" color="black"><p>The objective of this game is to go pass all three levels within the given time and to avoid all obstacles that come towards your way to victory.
    We added three new levels that range from easy to hard. Each level includes different sprites, backgrounds, and objectives.  It is a great and fun game that is enjoyable for everyone.</p>
