   <h1>Miles Martinez's Home Page</h1>
   <font face="impact" color="blue" <p>Hi, I'm Miles and this is my website.  I made this website to share my knowledge with my peers.  On the Portfolio page, you will find my latest works.  Each project is listed in chronological order and titled with its name and a  small description below it.
  The "About Me" page is where I give a little information about myself and share some pictures from my most beloved experiences.  I hope you enjoy my work and are satisfied with my website. Enjoy!</p> <style="display: block; margin-center: auto"></style></font>
